## Process - Reflection

 * Discussed communication
 * Highlighted importance of carful code review during pull request approvals
 * Considered work strategy changes

#### Decisions that turned out well

 * Starting very early this time and having a more detailed execution plan
 * Meeting frequency and duration decrease, only important points are being highlighted 
 * Work load distribution was very fair compared to previous sprints

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

 * Testing together with the person who made the pull request, this negatively impacted quality of tests as the person who worked on the task directed testing flow thus hindering testing uniqueness
 * Underestimating difficulty of some tasks and allocating less time for them.
 * last minute task creation caused a lot of stress on some members

#### Planned changes

 * More thorough testing
 * Better task planning with less ticket creation throughout the sprint
