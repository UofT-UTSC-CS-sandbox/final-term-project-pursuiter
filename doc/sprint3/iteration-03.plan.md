# Pursuiter

## Iteration 03

- Start date: 08/07/2024
- End date: 19/07/2024

## Process

#### Changes from previous iteration

- No changes to process from previous iteration.

#### Roles & responsibilities

- Elena Manneh is the Scrum Master
- All members develop both backend and frontend by picking up tickets from Jira and implementing the required functionality on a new branch on GitHub.
- After completing the functionality, a pull request is opened towards the development branch (dev), which is then reviewed by at least one more member and the ticket branch is deleted after merging.
- Members are required to do sufficient testing and formatting of the code they write

#### Events

- In-person meeting every Tuesday at 15:00 on campus, to discuss progress, challenges, and plan next steps.
- Daily asynchronous standup on on Slack. Purpose is to let team members know about your progress and what you will working on.
- Online meetings over Discord whenever there is an issue that needs to be discussed.

#### Artifacts

- We designed a priority ranking system from 1-3 for user stories to organize them into groups, after which they are further ordered based on prerequisites and significance to the sprint.
- We made a Jira board that is linked to our project GitHub. We use it to track tickets, visualize sprint progress and distribute weight of the work fairly across the team members.
- Initial task assignment is done during the first sprint planning meeting. Tasks maybe added, removed or reassigned based on availability of team members and discoveries made during development.

#### Git / GitHub workflow

- Branching Strategy: Our project uses a structured Git flow. All development should take place in feature branches, which should be created from the dev branch. Branch names must follow the format `PUR-ticketnumber`.
- Pull Requests (PRs): After completing development on a feature branch, a pull request is created to the dev branch. The PR title should clearly state the purpose of the changes, and the description should reference the relevant issue or ticket number.
- Code Reviews: At least one peer review is required for each pull request. This is done to ensure that the changes meet all project standards.
- Merging: No direct commits to the main branch are allowed. At the end of each development sprint, the dev branch is merged into main. This is done to ensure that dev is stable before performing the merge.
