#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

We are planning to build a job application platform called Pursuiter that provides tailored job recommendations to applicants and efficient applicant filtering for employers.

* **High-level description:** Pursuiter is a job application platform that leverages AI to help with a smooth job seeking and recruitment process. It assists job seekers in tailoring their applications for their desired positions. It also helps recruiters limit application to qualified candidates, as well as assists in evaluating and sorting candidates with minimal effort.
  
* **Problem:**
* Job seekers: Often get rejected due to not meeting minimum requirements. They also spend too much time tailoring applications with no feedback.
* Recruiters: Receive too many applications with few numbers of candidates who qualify. They also spend too much time reviewing the applications.
  
* **Solution:** Pursuiter aims to assist applicants by providing tailored job recommendations and help employers filter out unqualified applicants effectively. In addition, it empowers AI to rank applicants based on their qualifications and provide quick, short, and relevant summaries of the applicant to increase the effciency of the screening phase.
  
* **Product Type:** Website
* **Common Use Cases:**
  - **Applicants:** Receive job recommendations based on their profiles and qualifications, apply for jobs they are eligible for, and get feedback on their applications.
  - **Employers:** Post job listings, receive qualified applications, and filter applicants using AI-generated summaries and statistics.

#### Q2: Who are your target users? (2-3 personas)

1. **Student**
   - **Demographics:** Recent graduates or students in their final year, aged 21-25, looking for entry-level positions or internships.
   - **Goals:** Find job opportunities that match their qualifications and skills.
   - **Pain Points:** Difficulty in finding jobs that accept their level of experience, high rejection rates.

2. **Industry Candidate**
   - **Demographics:** Professionals with 2-5 years of experience in their industry, aged 25-35.
   - **Goals:** Find job opportunities that align with their career progression and skills.
   - **Pain Points:** Navigating through numerous job listings to find suitable positions, facing rejection from jobs they are over or under-qualified for.

3. **Employer**
   - **Demographics:** HR managers or recruiters, aged 30-50, working in companies of varying sizes.
   - **Goals:** Efficiently find qualified candidates for open positions.
   - **Pain Points:** Receiving too many unqualified applications, time-consuming process to filter and shortlist candidates.

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

**Why applicants would choose Pursuiter:**
- **Tailored Recommendations:** Before submitting an application, our platform offers AI generated feedback that is based on their profiles, resumes and the specific job they are applying for. This allows users to better showcase their qualifications for the role being applied to.
- **Efficient Application Process:** By getting AI generated feedback, this reduces the time and effort needed to personalize an application for the posting.
  
**Why employers would choose Pursuiter:**
- **Qualified Applicants:** Employers are able to set minimum requirements that are hidden to job seekers (possibly different than preferred qualifications which are shown on the posting). By doing so, applicants who do not meet the minimum requirements will not be able to apply, ensuring that employers receive less but more qualified applications.
- **Advanced Filtering:** Employers can sort applications using AI-generated summaries and statistics, making the shortlisting process more efficient.

**Current Solutions:**
- **Applicants:** Use generic job boards, face high rejection rates due to mismatched applications. More time and effort required to personalize applications.
- **Employers:** Use traditional job boards or recruiting agencies, spend a lot of time filtering through unqualified candidates.

#### Q4: What does "DONE" mean to your Team?

**Definition of Done:**
- All user stories have been implemented and tested.
- The platform includes the following features:
  - **Application Feature:** Personal profile creation, resume upload, application submission.
  - **Job Posting Feature:** Employers can post jobs with descriptions and keywords.
  - **Filtering and Sorting Feature:** AI-generated summaries, application filtering, and sorting for employers.
- All features are fully functional and meet the acceptance criteria defined by the team.

### Highlights

1. **Decision on Tailored Recommendations:** We considered generic job recommendations versus tailored recommendations. We chose tailored recommendations to increase the chances of applicants getting hired and to reduce rejection rates.
2. **Application Filtering:** We debated between manual filtering by employers and automated filtering using AI. Automated filtering was chosen to save employers time and improve efficiency.
3. **Employer Stats and Summaries:** We discussed providing basic application lists versus detailed AI-generated summaries. Detailed summaries were chosen to give employers better insights and make more informed decisions.
4. **Team Organization:** All members are full-stack developers to gain experience in all fields.
5. **Meeting Schedule:**
   - **Standups:** Everyday, online asynchronous.
   - **Tuesday Meeting:** 3:00 - 4:00 pm, in-person.
   - **Sprint Planning:** Thursday (before new sprint), 3:00 - 4:00 pm, online synchronous.
   - **Sprint Retro:** Thursday (after sprint ends), 3:00 - 4:00 pm, online synchronous.
   - All members get a ‘free pass’ to miss one meeting.
