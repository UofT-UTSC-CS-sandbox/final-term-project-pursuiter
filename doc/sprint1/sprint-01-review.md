# Pursuiter

## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

- When: 11/06/2024
- Where: IC406

## Process - Reflection

- Discussed work rate, things that need to modified in the future
- Evaluated the state of the project and decisions regarding it
- Considered needed optimizations of features in the sprint

#### Decisions that turned out well

- Thorough testing, review and evaluation of pull requests by multiple members: Before merging a feature into the development branch tests were made if needed, feature was tested by multiple members and if needed changes were made very swiftly insuring the high quality of the code before merging.
- Meeting content, structure and frequency: The meetings always felt necessary, were very productive and the frequency insured everyone's questions or concerns were promptly answered.
- Work flow and technologies: The process from picking up the ticket to completing it felt very straight forward and using things such as Jira, Figma, Discord, React, MongoDB, Node.js, Express made development faster.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

- Work load distribution for the sprint: it was hard to estimate the difficulty associated with the ticket and unexpected requirements for the ticket would arise together with changes in the ticket content itself resulting in some members experiencing higher intensity work, while other members had lower intensity work even though the quantity of the work was similar.
- Underestimating the learning aspect: Some members lacked experience with skills required for the sprint causing slow development at first and mistakes that were costly in terms of time to fix.
- Using Prettier on your code before opening a pull request: Introduced unnecessary merge conflicts.

#### Planned changes

- Discuss implementation of tickets in more details and make tickets more atomic: will help visualize and distribute work load.
- Using Prettier on development branch only before merging to main: to avoid constantly serving merge conflicts that don't need to be there.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

- All of them can be viewed on: https://github.com/UofT-UTSC-CS-sandbox/final-term-project-pursuiter
- Job seeker create account
- Employer create account
- User login
- Job seeker personal information
- Employer personal information (was not part of the original iteration plan)
- Employer job viewing
- Employer job posting
- job seeker job descriptions
- job seeker ability to apply to jobs (file upload included that was not part of the original iteration plan)
- Employer applicant viewing
- User landing page
- job seeker saving jobs (was not part of the original iteration plan)

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

- None, every planned task was completed.

## Meeting Highlights

- With each ticket discuss the potential implementation on the high-level and actual process for making the feature to set a more realistic estimated work load for all the tickets.
- Ask for help and collaborate often. Some issues could be solved faster if we leverage each other's experience on the project.
- Put more focus on how the tickets interact with each other, how integration can be made smoother and schedule tasks better to minimize group members waiting for each other.
