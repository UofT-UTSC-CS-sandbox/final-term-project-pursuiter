# Pursuiter

## Iteration 01

- Start date: 30/05/2024
- End date: 14/06/2024

## Process

#### Roles & responsibilities

- Elena Manneh is the Scrum Master
- All members develop both backend and frontend by picking up tickets from Jira and implementing the required functionality on a new branch on GitHub.
- After completing the functionality, a pull request is opened towards the development branch (dev), which is then reviewed by at least one more member and the ticket branch is deleted after merging.
- Members are required to do sufficient testing and formatting of the code they write

#### Events

- In-person meeting every Tuesday at 15:00 on campus, to discuss progress, challenges, and plan next steps.
- Daily asynchronous standup on on Slack. Purpose is to let team members know about your progress and what you will working on.
- Online meetings over Discord whenever there is an issue that needs to be discussed.

#### Artifacts

- We designed a priority ranking system from 1-3 for user stories to organize them into groups, after which they are further ordered based on prerequisites and significance to the sprint.
- We made a Jira board that is linked to our project GitHub. We use it to track tickets, visualize sprint progress and distribute weight of the work fairly across the team members.
- Initial task assignment is done during the first sprint planning meeting. Tasks maybe added, removed or reassigned based on availability of team members and discoveries made during development.
