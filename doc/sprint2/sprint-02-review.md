# Pursuiter

## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

* When: 04/07/2024
* Where: IC406

## Process - Reflection

* Discussed work rate, things that need to be modified in the future.
* Evaluated the state of the project and decisions regarding it.
* Considered needed optimizations of features in the sprint.

#### Decisions that turned out well

* Thorough testing, review, and evaluation of pull requests by multiple members: Before merging a feature into the development branch, tests were conducted as needed. Features were tested by multiple members, and changes were swiftly made if required, ensuring the high quality of the code before merging.
* Meeting content, structure, and frequency: The meetings always felt necessary, were very productive, and the frequency ensured everyone's questions or concerns were promptly answered.
* Workflow and technologies: The process from picking up the ticket to completing it felt very straightforward. Using tools such as Jira, Figma, Discord, React, MongoDB, Node.js, and Express made development faster.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

* Prioritizing requirements and task assignments: There were challenges with prioritizing requirements, leading to unclear task assignments.
* Function reuse: Issues with function reuse were encountered, indicating a need for better planning and documentation.
* Communication on Discord: Connection issues arose, particularly on the newest update of Discord, which impacted collaboration.

#### Planned changes

* Focus on edge cases in coding, not just core functionality: Ensuring that all scenarios are covered will improve overall code quality.
* Implement more thorough reviews: To ensure tasks are complete and comprehensive before moving on, we need to conduct more thorough reviews.
* Discuss implementation of tickets in more detail and make tickets more atomic: This will help visualize and distribute the workload more evenly.

* Ask for help and collaborate often. 
* Put more focus on how the tickets interact with each other, how integration can be made smoother, and schedule tasks better to minimize group members waiting for each other.
